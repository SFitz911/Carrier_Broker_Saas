## 💡 The Problem We're Solving

Brokers maintain one-sided performance boards that track truckers—but truckers can't access them and have no way to report bad brokers. 

**Carrier Board changes that.**

Truckers can now:
- ✅ Identify honest brokers who pay on time
- ✅ Report non-payment and poor practices
- ✅ See which brokers are trustworthy before taking a load
