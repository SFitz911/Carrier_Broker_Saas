## 💡 The Problem We're Solving

For years, brokers have maintained one-sided performance boards that track truckers—but truckers can't access them and have no way to rate brokers. 

**Carrier Board changes that.**

Truckers can now:
- ✅ Rate brokers and shippers on payment, communication, and honesty
- ✅ Warn other truckers about non-payment and poor practices
- ✅ See which brokers are trustworthy before taking a load
- ✅ Finally have a voice in an industry that's been one-sided for too long
