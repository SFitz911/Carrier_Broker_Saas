# 🚛 Carrier Board - Project Description & Goals

**Built by Sean Fitzgerald** | sfitz911@gmail.com

## 🎯 Project Mission

> **This is how you use I.T. to change the world.**

Carrier Board is a **trucker-only** rating platform designed to bring **transparency and fairness** to the logistics industry—one load at a time. Truckers rate brokers and shippers, not the other way around.

---

## 🔍 The Problem

I'm addressing the mistrust between two main groups in the logistics industry:

### Group 1: Shippers and Freight Brokers
- Negotiate rates for shippers
- Maintain one-sided performance boards tracking truckers
- Control access to performance data (requires brokerage license)

### Group 2: Truckers and Carriers
- Often believe they're being shorted on payments
- Suspect hidden margins and withheld payments
- Have no way to rate or report their experiences with brokers/shippers
- Cannot access performance boards without a brokerage license

**The current system is one-sided.** Brokers can track and rate truckers, but truckers have no voice.

---

## 💡 The Solution

**Carrier Board** gives truckers what they've never had: **the power to rate brokers and shippers**. This is a **trucker-only platform**—brokers and shippers cannot rate truckers here. This levels the playing field and finally gives truckers a voice.

### Key Features

#### 🤖 AI-Powered Tools
- **Simplified Data Entry**: Upload a BOL (Bill of Lading) or receipt, AI extracts key details automatically
- **Credential Verification**: Verify broker/shipper credentials (FMCSA, insurance, etc.)
- **Submission Validation**: Validate trucker submissions for authenticity
- **Fair Ratings**: Generate data-driven ratings based on:
  - Payment history and speed
  - Communication quality
  - Load accuracy and honesty
  - Professionalism
  - Reported issues

#### 🎯 Core Benefits
- ✅ Gives truckers **visibility** and **a voice** they've never had
- ✅ Helps reduce **fraud**, **non-payment**, and **poor practices**
- ✅ Encourages **accountability from brokers and shippers**
- ✅ Creates a **transparent marketplace** built on trust

## 🌟 Why This Matters

The logistics industry moves America. Truckers are the backbone of our economy, yet they've been operating without the same transparency and power that brokers have always had.

**Carrier Board changes that.**

By creating a trucker-only rating platform:
- Truckers can identify honest brokers who pay on time
- Truckers can warn others about brokers who don't pay or cheat
- Bad brokers and shippers are finally held accountable
- Good brokers have nothing to fear—they'll rise to the top
- The entire industry becomes more efficient and fair

This isn't just a website—**it's a movement to give truckers their voice back.**
